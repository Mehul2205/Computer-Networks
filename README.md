# Computer-Networks
In this Repository, all codes are present which I have created while studying computer network in my college

## Assignment 1

Implement UDP socket programming for client server communication

## Assignment 2

Part 1: Re-implement program given in assignment 1 using UDP socket.
Part 2: Modify assignment 1 such that client and server need not require strict alternate turn
for sending data.
Part 3: Implement concurrent sever using TCP socket. A concurrent server is one which can
accept connection request from multiple clients concurrently and serve them concurrently.
(Hint: Use threading). Your server should return the addition and subtraction of the two
numbers sent by any client to that client. Assume that there are no errors.

## Assignment 2 with Thread

All the tasks is same as above assignment only change is that now it is more efficent and using different thread for receiving and sending messags.

## Assignment 3

Write a Program to implement CRC Algorithm using socket programming. 

## Assignment 4

Write a program to implement Go-Back-N 

## Hangman Game

Make a Hangman game using client server communication in socket programming

## Minimum spanning Tree

Write a Program to draw minimum spanning tree

## Multiplayer Tic-Tac-toe Game

Write a program to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game using socket programming.
