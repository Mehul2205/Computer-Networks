# Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

A Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ based on the client-server model using the basics of socket programming.

Currently the source code has been compiled for Linux systems. Here's what the server (Player 1) needs to do to set up a game :

```
./server.out    
```
server.out is the compiled output file for creating the server.                                                                             

The client (Player 2) should type in -

```
./client.out 192.0.2.80
```

client.out is the compiled output file for connecting to the server and 192.0.2.80 is the IP address of the server(say). Given a server has already been set up, the client should be able to connect comfortably to the server.

Feel free to report any bugs. Suggestions are welcome.
